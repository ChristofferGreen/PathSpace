# PathSpace documentation rules
# This file describes the intended purpose, audience, and editing guidelines
# for content located under ./docs/.

rules_version: 1
applies_to: "./docs"

general:
  purpose: >
    Provide architecture, design, and usage documentation for PathSpace that is
    accurate, concise, and kept in sync with the source code and build tooling.
  audience:
    - New engineers onboarding to the codebase
    - AI assistants performing code analysis or edits
    - Contributors proposing changes to core subsystems
  writing_style:
    - Prefer concise, direct language
    - Use Markdown headings and lists; keep sections scannable
    - Use relative links within the repository where relevant
    - Use backticks for file/directory names like `src/pathspace/...`
    - Prefer diagrams (Mermaid or SVG) when they add clarity, but keep text authoritative
  cross_references:
    - When referencing code, include the full repo-relative path
    - Keep references stable; if files move, update the docs in the same PR
  change_management:
    - If a change affects core behavior (paths, NodeData, WaitMap, TaskPool, serialization),
      update `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`
    - If a change affects build or scripts (CMake, scripts/*), update relevant build/test documentation accordingly
    - Add or update images in `docs/images/` as needed, with appropriate alt text

documents:


  - path: "docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md"
    title: "PathSpace â€” Architecture"
    purpose: >
      In-depth design document explaining path abstractions, internal data structures,
      pattern matching, performance considerations, thread-safety, and error handling.
    audience:
      - Engineers modifying internals
      - Reviewers assessing architectural changes
    must_keep_sections:
      - "Introduction"
      - "Path System" (and sub-sections)
      - "Internal Data"
      - "Syntax Example"
      - "Polymorphism"
      - "Path Globbing"
    editing_guidelines:
      - Keep headings and structure stable to preserve external references
      - Update examples when APIs or semantics change (e.g., path iteration, matching)
      - If adding new path features, include rationale and complexity/perf notes
      - Prefer illustrative examples and light pseudo-code over full code dumps
    performance_notes:
      - Summarize expected complexity of critical operations
      - Note memory/perf trade-offs for `NodeData`, hash maps, and buffers
    anti_patterns:
      - Avoid speculative sections not backed by code or planned work
      - Avoid duplicating content already in other docs; cross-reference instead

  - path: "docs/images/"
    title: "Documentation Images"
    purpose: "Static assets for diagrams and figures referenced by docs"
    file_conventions:
      preferred_formats:
        - "SVG (preferred for vector diagrams)"
        - "PNG (fallback)"
      naming:
        - "Use kebab-case, e.g., pathspace-architecture.svg"
        - "Prefix by topic when appropriate, e.g., waitmap-sequence.svg"
      size_limits:
        advisory_max_kb: 750
        rationale: "Keep repository lightweight; compress where possible"
      accessibility:
        - "Provide alt text or a caption near the image reference"
        - "Ensure diagrams are legible in both light and dark modes"
    editing_guidelines:
      - Store only source-of-truth images; no binaries unrelated to docs
      - Keep diagrams updated when flows or components change
      - For Mermaid diagrams, prefer embedding in Markdown over exporting static images

  - path: "docs/AI_TODO.task"
    title: "AI Backlog"
    purpose: >
      Source-of-truth backlog of AI-facing tasks and epics. Keep in sync with
      `docs/AI_ARCHITECTURE.md`; link tasks to code/tests.
    audience:
      - AI assistants
      - Maintainers planning/triaging work
    editing_guidelines:
      - Keep tasks concise with status, priority, and acceptance criteria.
      - Cross-link to relevant docs sections and repo paths (tests, src files).
      - Update alongside behavioral changes affecting the listed tasks.

validation_checklist:
  - "All referenced file paths exist and are current"
  - "Examples compile or reflect valid commands"
  - "Sections listed in must_keep_sections are present"
  - "Images referenced in Markdown are present in docs/images/"
  - "Any changed script or build workflow is reflected in repository docs"
  - "Links are relative and not pointing to external resources unless necessary"
  - "Backlog at docs/AI_TODO.task is present, referenced here, and tasks stay in sync with docs and code"


contributor_notes:
  - "Small doc fixes may be committed with nearby code changes"
  - "Large restructures should be proposed with an outline before editing"
  - "If unsure whether to update AI_ARCHITECTURE.md, update it and ask in review"
  - "For build/test changes, run: ./scripts/compile.sh [--clean] [-j N] and ensure tests pass"
