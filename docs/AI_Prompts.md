Never create a new git branch, only ever use master.
Current Plan doc is ./docs/Plan_PathSpace_FanIn.md
1. Have a read through of the docs in ./docs.
2. Pick the highest prio item we should implement from Current Plan doc.
3. Come up with a plan for implementation

1. Implement that, run the tests and make a commit then tell me what the next thing to implement is.
2. Shut down, update the pertinent docs in ./docs with the current status so that we can hit the ground running fast when we start working again.
3. If the Current Plan doc is finished, has nothing left to do then append _Finished to it's name and move it to ./docs/finished/ and update any docs that point to it.
