1. Have a read through of the docs in ./docs.
2. Tell me what is the highest prio item we should implement from docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Implementation.md.

Great, implement that, run the tests and make a commit then tell me what the next thing to implement is.

We are shutting down now so update the pertinent docs in ./docs with the current status so that we can hit the ground running fast when we start working again.
