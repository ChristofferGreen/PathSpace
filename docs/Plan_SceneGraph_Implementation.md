# Handoff Notice

> **Handoff note (October 19, 2025):** This roadmap captures the state at the end of the previous assistant cycle. New assistants should record fresh status updates here after consulting `docs/AI_Onboarding_Next.md`.

# Scene Graph Implementation Plan

> **Context update (October 15, 2025):** Implementation phases now assume the assistant context introduced for this cycle; convert prior context cues to the updated vocabulary during execution.

## Context and Objectives
- Groundwork for implementing the renderer stack described in `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md` and the broader architecture contract in `docs/AI_Architecture.md`.
- Deliver an incremental path from today's codebase to the MVP (software renderer, CAMetalLayer-based presenters, surfaces, snapshot builder), while keeping room for GPU rendering backends (Metal/Vulkan) and HTML adapters outlined in the master plan.
- Maintain app-root atomic semantics, immutable snapshot guarantees, and observability expectations throughout the rollout.

Success looks like:
- A new `src/pathspace/ui/` subsystem shipping the MVP feature set behind build flags.
- Repeatable end-to-end tests (including 15√ó loop runs) covering snapshot publish/adopt, render, and present flows.
- Documentation, metrics, and diagnostics that let maintainers debug renderer issues without spelunking through the code.

## Status Snapshot (October 19, 2025)
- Shared macOS local window handling now lives in `src/pathspace/ui/LocalWindowBridge.mm`; examples call the bridge, and the legacy `WindowEventPump` code has been removed.
- `./scripts/compile_paint.sh` builds cleanly; keep using it plus the 15√ó loop harness to validate UI changes before hand-off.
- Metal uploads remain gated behind `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_METAL_UPLOADS`; the next milestone is establishing shared material descriptors so software/Metal telemetry matches.
- Residency metrics published under `diagnostics/metrics/residency/*` are live‚Äîwire them into dashboards/CI as we expand GPU coverage.

## Workstream Overview
- **Typed wiring helpers** ‚Äî `Builders.hpp` plus supporting utilities for app-relative path validation, target naming, and atomic parameter writes.
- **Scene authoring & snapshot builder** ‚Äî authoring tree schema, dirty tracking, layout, `DrawableBucket` emission, and revision lifecycle/GC.
- **Renderer core (software first)** ‚Äî target settings adoption, traversal of snapshots, draw command execution, color pipeline defaults, and concurrency controls.
- **Surfaces & presenters** ‚Äî target configuration, render execution coordination, CAMetalLayer-backed window presentation, progressive software mode, and UI-thread integrations.
- **Input & hit testing** ‚Äî DrawableBucket-driven hit paths, focus routing, and notification hooks for scene edits and event delivery.
- **Diagnostics & metrics** ‚Äî unified `PathSpaceError` usage, per-target metrics, progressive copy counters, and troubleshooting hooks.
- **Resource residency & tooling** ‚Äî enforce per-resource policy, adopt fingerprints across snapshots/renderers, refresh compile commands, and extend automation/test harnesses.
- **Testing discipline** ‚Äî when you discover a coverage gap, either land the test or capture the follow-up in this plan / `docs/AI_Todo.task` so the gap is visible for the next cycle.

Each workstream lands independently but respects shared contracts (paths, atomic writes, revision pinning).

### Helper API Contract
- Location: `src/pathspace/ui/Helpers.hpp` with namespaces `Scene`, `Renderer`, `Surface`, `Window`, and `Diagnostics`.
- All helpers accept a `PathSpace&` plus typed `ConcretePath` aliases (`ScenePath`, `RendererPath`, etc.); no raw string paths cross the boundary.
- Responsibilities:
  - Enforce app-root containment and canonical naming (e.g., `renderers/<id>/targets/...`).
  - Serialize payloads into `NodeData` using existing Alpaca/typed codecs; no helper owns synchronization beyond atomic inserts/takes.
  - Return `SP::Expected<T>` for error propagation aligned with core PathSpace errors.
- Usage: SceneGraph code consumes these helpers exclusively instead of embedding path literals; tests mock them to isolate higher layers.
- Future additions (Metal/HTML adapters) extend these namespaces rather than reaching into core PathSpace directly.

## Immediate Next Steps
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) `PathRenderer2D` executes Rect, RoundedRect, Image, TextGlyphs, Path, and Mesh commands in linear light, respecting opaque/alpha ordering and updating drawable/unsupported metrics.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Replaced the macOS window presenter‚Äôs CoreGraphics blit with the CAMetalLayer-backed zero-copy path, validated fullscreen resize/perf behaviour manually, and updated the example/docs.
 - ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) PathSurfaceSoftware and PathWindowView now share an IOSurface-backed framebuffer so the presenter can bind the surface without memcpy; the zero-copy path is the new default on macOS.
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) PathRenderer2D now limits damage to tiles touched by drawables whose fingerprints/bounds changed, so unchanged revisions (including id renames) emit zero progressive updates; fullscreen repaints are reserved for resize/clear-color changes (see ‚ÄúIncremental software renderer‚Äù below for remaining diagnostics and hint work).
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) Progressive repaint flicker in `./build/paint_example` is resolved. Damage tracing (`PATHSPACE_TRACE_DAMAGE=1`) now shows the buffered framebuffer retaining previous content, and interactive runs match the automated regression (`Window::Present progressive updates preserve prior content`). Keep the loop harness green and capture traces again if the behaviour regresses.
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) End-to-end `Window::Present` coverage now codifies progressive seqlock behaviour: tests drive a presenter through the builders API, assert the `progressiveSkipOddSeq` metrics, and verify deadline bookkeeping (`waitBudgetMs`/staleness) using the new before-present hook in `Builders::Window::TestHooks`.
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) Added multi-target `Window::Present` scenarios to ensure renderer caches stay per-target: two surfaces backed by the same renderer now exercise independent frame indices, stored framebuffers, and progressive metrics through the builders API.
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) Automated the AlwaysFresh/deadline regression by reusing the before-present hook to force buffered-frame drops, asserting the skip path (`lastPresentSkipped`, `presentedAge*`, `waitBudgetMs`) and guarding against unintended auto-render enqueues.
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) Dirty hint buckets snap to progressive tile boundaries so `PATHSPACE_TRACE_DAMAGE=1` logs stay readable at 4K; doctests cover the presenter metrics emitted when hints restrict the damage region.
- ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Achieved FPS parity between small and 4K windows and hardened diagnostics to catch regressions; keep monitoring traces but no longer treat as an open blocker.
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) Progressive tile fan-out now distributes work across all available CPU cores with a fixed 64‚ÄØpx tile size so incremental strokes remain ~140‚ÄØFPS, and metrics continue to surface `progressiveTilesUpdated` / `progressiveBytesCopied`.
  - ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) Instrumented the fine-grained benchmark suite with per-phase timings (damage diff, encode, progressive copy, IOSurface publish, presenter present) to pinpoint 4‚ÄØK full-clear hotspots; benchmark output now reports these averages.
  - ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Hardened `paint_example`: stroke segments now batch their dirty hints, idle frames no longer submit full-surface publishes, and surface resizing reuses the existing IOSurface allocation so long sessions stay within range-group limits.
  - ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Presenter now skips IOSurface-to-CPU copies unless `capture_framebuffer` is set, eliminating the 22‚ÄØMB memcpy per frame while retaining a debug/toggle for diagnostics.
  - ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) CAMetalLayer presenting now reuses a bounded IOSurface pool, preventing range-group exhaustion during long-running sessions.
  - üí§ (Optional) Add stroke-compositing to `paint_example` so successive brush strokes bake into a persistent texture (or coalesced drawable) rather than growing the snapshot unbounded; keeps long-running demos at steady FPS without exhausting IOSurface range groups.
  - ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) `Builders::SubmitDirtyRects` now normalizes and coalesces hints automatically, snapping to the surface tile grid and clamping to bounds so apps can pass raw rectangles without bespoke math.
  - ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) `paint_example` now forwards raw brush rectangles directly to the helper; manual tile snapping and hint merging were removed.
- For Phase 4 follow-ups, finish the broader end-to-end scene‚Üírender‚Üípresent scenarios, expand presenter wiring through `Window::Present`, surface the remaining progressive-mode diagnostics, and rerun the loop harness once integrations land.
- Begin Phase 5 test authoring for hit ordering, clip-aware picking, focus routing, and event delivery latency; follow with DrawableBucket-backed picking and wait/notify integration for dirty markers and auto-render scheduling.
- Line up Phase 6 diagnostics/tooling work: extend error/metrics coverage, normalize `PathSpaceError` reporting, expand scripts for UI log capture, and draft the debugging playbook updates before the next hardening pass.

### Incremental software renderer (new priority, October 17, 2025)
- Scope: keep the zero-copy path but eliminate full-surface repaints when only a small region changes.
- Current status:
  - ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) PathRenderer2D now caches per-target drawable fingerprints/bounds and diffs revisions so unchanged drawables (including id renames) leave the damage region empty; idle frames report zero progressive tile updates in tests.
  - ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) SceneSnapshotBuilder fingerprints are derived from transforms/bounds/commands (drawable ids no longer influence the hash), so renaming a drawable without changing its content reuses the cached damage state.
  - ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) `paint_example` skips redundant publishes on resize-only frames and forwards brush dirty rectangles via the new renderer hint path, so dragging a 2560‚ÄØpx canvas keeps >55‚ÄØFPS except while actively laying down fresh strokes.
- Immediate next steps:
  - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Locked in the progressive tiling strategy: default tile size stays 64√ó64 px (‚âà510 tiles at 1080p, ‚âà920 at 1440p, ‚âà2‚ÄØ040 at 4K), and new per-frame metrics (`progressiveTileSize`, `progressiveWorkersUsed`, `progressiveJobs`, `encodeWorkersUsed`, `encodeJobs`) now track how much work hits the worker pool so multi-core utilisation remains visible in logs/dashboards.
  - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Surface diagnostics around skipped tiles now land in the renderer metrics: run `./build/benchmarks/path_renderer2d_benchmark --metrics [--canvas=WIDTHxHEIGHT]` to enable `PATHSPACE_UI_DAMAGE_METRICS` and print coverage, dirty/skip ratios, and fingerprint deltas without attaching a debugger.
  - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Captured updated FPS deltas after the encode parallelism landed. `path_renderer2d_benchmark` now accepts `--canvas=WIDTHxHEIGHT`, and on the reference Mac Studio the results are:
    - 3840√ó2160: full repaint avg 41‚ÄØms (‚âà24‚ÄØFPS) vs incremental strokes avg 7.0‚ÄØms (‚âà142‚ÄØFPS), encode ‚âà26‚ÄØms of the full repaint and ‚âà0.3‚ÄØms incremental.
    - 1280√ó720: full repaint avg 4.9‚ÄØms (‚âà203‚ÄØFPS) vs incremental strokes avg 1.1‚ÄØms (‚âà897‚ÄØFPS), encode ‚âà3.1‚ÄØms of the full repaint and ‚âà0.3‚ÄØms incremental.
    - Progressive bytes copied per incremental stroke stay ‚âà0.07‚ÄØMB thanks to the tile hint path; full repaints move ‚âà33‚ÄØMB at 4K and ‚âà3.7‚ÄØMB at 720p.
  - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Parallelized the encode phase: damage regions expand into per-tile encode jobs that run across the shared worker queue, cutting full-surface encode time and matching the progressive tiling model on multi-core hosts.
- Runtime targets:
  - Incremental updates should be the steady state: typical UI strokes touch only a handful of tiles, keeping frame cost well under the 16‚ÄØms (~60‚ÄØHz) budget.
  - Full-surface repaints remain first-class. Camera moves or scene-wide changes explicitly flip the damage region to `set_full()`, then PathRenderer2D fan-outs tiles across all CPU cores (tile-per-thread queue) so repainting a 4K surface still clears ‚â§16‚ÄØms once the inner loops are vectorized.
  - The software path owns these full clears; GPU assists stay optional (e.g. secondary effects), not the default ‚Äúdraw everything every frame,‚Äù so the hybrid design preserves the progressive/tiled CPU pipeline.
- Validation:
  - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Added renderer doctest coverage for incremental stroke, erase, clear-color, and dirty rect hint scenarios (see `tests/ui/test_PathRenderer2D.cpp`), with explicit assertions on damage coverage, fingerprint deltas, and progressive tile counts.
  - Capture comparative FPS traces (small-vs-fullscreen) to confirm the fullscreen slowdown disappears.

## Phase Plan
### Phase 0 ‚Äî Foundations (1 sprint)
- Audit existing `PathSpace` helpers for app-relative enforcement; add shared utilities if missing.
- Introduce feature flags/CMake options (`PATHSPACE_ENABLE_UI`, `PATHSPACE_UI_SOFTWARE`, `PATHSPACE_UI_METAL`, `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_APP`, `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_EXTRA`) without functionality to keep builds green.
- Update Doxygen/docs stubs to reserve namespaces (`pathspace/ui/*`) and ensure compile_commands integration works.
- ‚úÖ (October 11, 2025) `SP::App` helpers landed in `src/pathspace/app/AppPaths.{hpp,cpp}` with root normalization, app-relative resolution, and target base validation for reuse across UI and tooling layers.
- ‚úÖ (October 11, 2025) Top-level CMake now exposes `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_UI` (default OFF) plus `PATHSPACE_UI_SOFTWARE` / `PATHSPACE_UI_METAL`, `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_APP`, and `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_EXTRA` flags, and the library/tests gate feature-specific sources on these toggles.

### Phase 1 ‚Äî Typed Helpers & Path Semantics (1 sprint)
Completed:
- ‚úÖ (October 14, 2025) Added doctest coverage in `tests/ui/test_Builders.cpp` for idempotent scene creation, cross-app rejection, and atomic `Renderer::UpdateSettings` behaviour (path containment + queue draining).
- ‚úÖ (October 14, 2025) Validated Builders via `./scripts/compile.sh --loop=15 --per-test-timeout 20` (15 iterations, 20 s per-test timeout).
- ‚úÖ (October 11, 2025) Initial UI helper implementations (`src/pathspace/ui/Helpers.cpp`) enforce app-root containment for scene/renderer/surface/window calls with accompanying doctests in `tests/ui/test_SceneHelpers.cpp`; remaining work will flesh out Builders.hpp and atomic settings writes.
- ‚úÖ (October 14, 2025) Documented Builders usage patterns and invariants in `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md` (idempotent creates, atomic settings, app-root enforcement); no new canonical paths required for `AI_Paths.md`.

### Phase 2 ‚Äî Scene Schema & Snapshot Builder (2 sprints)
Completed:
- ‚úÖ (October 14, 2025) `SceneSnapshotBuilder` now emits full SoA drawable data (transforms, bounds, material/pipeline metadata, command offsets/counts, command stream, opaque/alpha/per-layer indices) and documents the layout in `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md` / `docs/AI_Architecture.md`.
- ‚úÖ (October 14, 2025) Added doctests in `tests/ui/test_SceneSnapshotBuilder.cpp` covering round-trip decoding plus retention under burst publishes.
- ‚úÖ (October 15, 2025) Added long-running publish/prune stress coverage with metrics validation and GC metric emission (retained/evicted/last_revision/total_fingerprint_count) in `tests/ui/test_SceneSnapshotBuilder.cpp`.
- ‚úÖ (October 15, 2025) Snapshot metadata now records resource fingerprints per revision; GC metrics aggregate total fingerprint counts for residency planning.
- ‚úÖ (October 15, 2025) Documented the finalized binary artifact split (`drawables.bin`, `transforms.bin`, `bounds.bin`, `state.bin`, `cmd-buffer.bin`, index files) and retired the Alpaca fallback in `docs/AI_Architecture.md` / `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md`.

### Phase 3 ‚Äî Software Renderer Core (2 sprints)
Completed:
- ‚úÖ (October 15, 2025) Builders `Surface::RenderOnce` / `Window::Present` now call `PathRenderer2D` synchronously via `Renderer::TriggerRender`, return ready `FutureAny` handles, and update target metrics; doctests cover the integration path.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) `PathRenderer2D` now executes recorded Rect and RoundedRect commands in linear light, keeps the opaque/alpha partitioning path alive, and publishes drawable/cull/command metrics with doctest coverage for success/error flows.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Added a deterministic golden framebuffer harness (with `PATHSPACE_UPDATE_GOLDENS`) plus render/present loop regressions that exercise `Surface::RenderOnce` and `Window::Present` under repeated runs; comparisons are tolerance-aware to track subtle output drift.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Instrumented the renderer to report sort-key violations, approximate overdraw coverage, and progressive-copy counters under `output/v1/common/*` for tooling/CI.

Remaining:
- Re-run the looped test suite and inspect goldens post implementation.

### Phase 4 ‚Äî Surfaces, Presenters, and Progressive Mode (2 sprints)
Completed:
- ‚úÖ (October 15, 2025) `PathSurfaceSoftware` progressive buffer + double-buffer landed with dedicated UI tests.
- ‚úÖ (October 15, 2025) `PathWindowView` now presents buffered/progressive frames and writes presenter metrics via `Builders::Diagnostics::WritePresentMetrics`; UI tests split into `PathSpaceUITests` for isolation.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) End-to-end scene ‚Üí render ‚Üí present doctests cover policy permutations, progressive copy assertions, and diagnostics outputs through `Builders::Window::Present`.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Presenter integration routes through `Window::Present`, emitting progressive-mode metrics, wait-budget data, and auto-render scheduling hooks that enqueue `AutoRenderRequestEvent` when frames remain stale.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Seqlock and deadline behaviour codified via `PathWindowView` and builder tests, ensuring wait-budget clamps and progressive copy skips are observable.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Compile/test loop harness revalidated after presenter integration (15√ó repeat, 20 s timeout) confirming stability.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Software presenter now publishes captured framebuffers under `output/v1/software/framebuffer`, enabling downstream inspection of rendered bytes alongside metadata.
- ‚úÖ (October 17, 2025) Added a minimal paint-style demo (`examples/paint_example.cpp`) that wires the scene‚Üírender‚Üípresent stack together, supports dynamic canvas resizing, and interpolates mouse strokes so contributors can exercise the full software path end-to-end.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) macOS window presentation now uses a CAMetalLayer-backed Metal swapchain (IOSurface copies + present) instead of CoreGraphics blits; fullscreen perf is no longer CPU bound.

Completed:
- ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Added fullscreen CAMetalLayer regression coverage in `PathSpaceUITests` and defaulted the presenter to zero-copy unless `capture_framebuffer` is explicitly enabled; perf regressions now fail under the UI harness.
- (Done) IOSurface-backed software framebuffer landed with PathSurfaceSoftware/PathWindowView zero-copy integration; future work should iterate on diagnostics rather than copy elimination.

### Phase 5 ‚Äî Input, Hit Testing, and Notifications (1 sprint)
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) Added doctest scenarios for hit ordering, clip-aware picking, focus routing, and auto-render event scheduling via `Scene::HitTest`; notifications enqueue `AutoRenderRequestEvent` under `events/renderRequested/queue`.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) `Scene::HitTest` now emits scene/local coordinates and per-path focus metadata so event routing can derive local offsets without re-reading scene state; doctests cover the new fields.
- ‚úÖ (October 16, 2025) `Scene::MarkDirty` / `Scene::TakeDirtyEvent` surface dirty markers via `diagnostics/dirty/state` and a queue, and tests confirm renderers can wait on the queue without polling.
- ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Exercised the blocking dirty-event wait/notify loop under the mandated 15√ó harness; the `Scene dirty event wait-notify latency stays within budget` doctest asserts <200‚ÄØms wake latency, preserves sequence ordering, and architecture docs now capture the latency/ordering guarantee plus the Metal‚Üísoftware fallback rule when uploads are disabled.

### Phase 6 ‚Äî Diagnostics, Tooling, and Hardening (1 sprint)
- ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Extended diagnostics coverage with unit tests that write/read present metrics (`Diagnostics::WritePresentMetrics`/`ReadTargetMetrics`) and verify error clearing; tooling now has regression coverage for metric persistence.
- ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Normalized presenter/renderer error reporting around `PathSpaceError`, wiring `diagnostics/errors/live` and exposing codes/revisions via `Diagnostics::ReadTargetMetrics`.
- ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Expanded `scripts/compile.sh`/CTest to cover UI components and capture failure logs via `scripts/run-test-with-logs.sh`, ensuring loop runs retain artifacts on failure.
- ‚úÖ (October 18, 2025) Published `docs/AI_Debugging_Playbook.md` with the end-to-end diagnostics workflow and re-validated the 15√ó loop harness (`./scripts/compile.sh --test --loop=15 --per-test-timeout=20`).

### Phase 7 ‚Äî Optional Backends & HTML Adapter Prep (post-MVP)
- üöß (October 18, 2025) Added skipped `PathSpaceUITests` scaffolding for integration replay, ObjC++ Metal harness, and HTML command parity; populate with assertions once the backends land.
- üöß (October 18, 2025) Introduced `PathSurfaceMetal` stub (texture allocation + resize) gated behind `PATHSPACE_UI_METAL`, linked Metal/QuartzCore, ready for presenter integration.
- üöß (October 19, 2025) Builders can now provision Metal targets end-to-end; the software renderer still populates Metal surfaces, and optional GPU uploads are gated on `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_METAL_UPLOADS=1` so CI remains headless-safe. Builder/UI tests publish a minimal snapshot before touching Metal paths to guarantee the software renderer has drawables to consume.
- ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) PathSurfaceMetal now caches the shared material descriptors emitted by PathRenderer2D so GPU uploads reuse the same shading telemetry when `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_METAL_UPLOADS=1`.
- ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Renderer residency metrics now aggregate software surfaces and cached image payloads, publishing accurate CPU/GPU byte totals for diagnostics before enabling GPU shading.
- ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Adaptive progressive tile sizing tightens tile dimensions for localized damage so brush-sized updates stick to 32‚Äì64 px tiles instead of full-surface fan-out, trimming encode work ahead of FPS parity tuning.
- Extended Metal renderer (GPU raster path) gated by `PATHSPACE_UI_METAL`; build atop the baseline Metal presenter, confirm ObjC++ integration, and expand CI coverage. **Implementation plan map (Oct 18, 2025, updated Oct 19):**
1. **Renderer kind plumbing**
    - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) `Builder::Renderer::Create` metadata now persists the requested `RendererKind`, and helpers/tests consume the new params signature.
    - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) `prepare_surface_render_context` resolves renderer kind per target, routing targets through cached software or Metal surfaces while keeping the software fallback as default when uploads stay disabled.
2. **Surface cache & rendering loop**
    - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Split render helpers so Metal targets reuse the shared cache but funnel through a backend-aware `render_into_target`; contexts fall back to software when uploads are disabled and tests exercise the unified path.
    - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) PathRenderer2D now streams Metal frames directly into the cached CAMetalLayer texture (skipping the software upload hop when Metal uploads are enabled) while keeping residency metrics in sync.
    - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) `Renderer::TriggerRender` now reuses the shared surface caches (software and Metal) so ad-hoc renders avoid reallocating per call.
    - üöß (October 20, 2025) Added `PathRenderer2DMetal` so Metal2D targets bypass the CPU raster when scenes contain only rect drawables; falls back to the software path for unsupported commands. Extend the encoder to rounded rects, images, glyph batches, and true material bindings next.
 3. **Presenter integration**
     - Extend `PathWindowView::Present` (Apple) to accept either `PathSurfaceSoftware` or `PathSurfaceMetal` stats; when Metal uploads are enabled, acquire CAMetalLayer drawable and blit/encode GPU texture to drawable using Metal command queue (move logic from WindowEventPump into core presenter).
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Replaced the sample-specific `WindowEventPump.mm` with the shared `LocalWindowBridge` in the UI library; examples now consume the bridge and keep only input wiring.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) PathWindowView now drives CAMetalLayer presents via the UI library, records GPU encode/present timings, and exposes configuration hooks; example harnesses only forward window/layer handles. Remaining platform scaffolding will shrink to input/event dispatch as the shared bridge matures.
4. **Settings & diagnostics**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Extended `SurfaceDesc`/`RenderSettings` with Metal options (storage mode, usage flags, iosurface backing) and recorded the resolved backend/Metal upload state per frame so diagnostics retain GPU context alongside timings/errors.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Persist `diagnostics/errors/live` / `output/v1/common` updates for Metal frames (frameIndex, renderMs, GPU timings) and gate residency/cache metrics under `diagnostics/metrics/residency` so dashboards can track resource pressure.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) PathRenderer2D now maintains a shared material descriptor cache so Metal and software paths emit identical shading telemetry across backends.
5. **Testing & CI**
    - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Added a PATHSPACE_ENABLE_METAL_UPLOADS-gated ObjC++ PathSpaceUITest (`tests/ui/test_PathWindowView_Metal.mm`) that exercises the CAMetalLayer presenter when Metal uploads are enabled.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Local `pre-push` hook now auto-enables Metal presenter coverage (`--enable-metal-tests`) on macOS hosts, while respecting `DISABLE_METAL_TESTS=1` to fall back when GPU access is unavailable.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) GitHub Actions now runs a macOS job that invokes `./scripts/compile.sh --enable-metal-tests --test --loop=1`, while tests continue to skip gracefully when Metal uploads remain disabled or unsupported.
     - Builders/UI diagnostic suites leave Metal-specific assertions to the gated UITest so the core builders coverage stays backend-agnostic even when PATHSPACE_ENABLE_METAL_UPLOADS=1.
6. **Follow-ups**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Renderer stats and diagnostics now cover GPU error paths end-to-end; tests assert Diagnostics::ReadTargetMetrics surfaces Metal presenter failures.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Shader/material system parity established by deriving shared shader keys from software pipeline flags and exposing them to the Metal surface.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Resource residency metrics now aggregate texture usage for GPU paths; Metal surfaces track resource fingerprints and publish residency totals.
- ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) PATHSPACE_ENABLE_METAL_UPLOADS coverage now exercises the full Metal present path, checks shader/material descriptor parity, and asserts residency/cache metrics (cpu/gpu bytes) are published so dashboards/CI immediately flag resource pressure regressions (`tests/ui/test_PathWindowView_Metal.mm`: "Metal pipeline publishes residency metrics and material descriptors").
- **HTML follow-ups (October 19, 2025):** remaining work is resource-loader integration for fonts/images and documenting fidelity troubleshooting (see Phase‚ÄØ7 items 5‚Äì6); new CI harness (`HtmlCanvasVerify`) is in place‚Äîkeep it updated when adapter schemas evolve.
  - **Oct 20, 2025 update:** Work is paused because PathSpace core drops serialized `Html::Asset` vectors on read. Resume only after the core serialization fix lands; see `docs/AI_Todo.task` (`HTML Asset Hydration Bug [BLOCKER]`) and `docs/AI_Debugging_Playbook.md` ¬ß7 for the latest repro details.
- HTML adapter scaffolding (command stream emitter + replay harness) behind experimental flag. **Implementation plan map (Oct 18, 2025):**
  1. **Adapter core API**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) `Html::Adapter::emit` now produces DOM/CSS/canvas outputs and honours emit options.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Snapshot traversal supplies drawable buckets and fingerprints directly to the adapter.
  2. **Command stream emitter**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) DOM serializer and canvas JSON fallback reuse the drawable command stream while respecting node budgets and fallback policy.
     - Emit asset blobs (images/fonts) via fingerprint paths; integrate with resource loader follow-up.
  3. **Replay harness**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Added standalone HTML runner (tests/ui + example) that replays canvas command streams and checks parity with PathRenderer2D output.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Doctest coverage compares PathRenderer2D framebuffer against replayed canvas output to guard regressions.
  4. **Builder integration**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Renderer targets now emit HTML outputs under `output/v1/html/{dom,css,commands,assets}` using the adapter and persist the applied options.
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) HTML `Window::Present` now enforces the `AlwaysLatestComplete` policy, writes diagnostics/residency metrics, and is covered by doctests (`Window::Present writes HTML present metrics and residency`).
  5. **Tooling & CI**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Added the Node-based `HtmlCanvasVerify` CTest (backed by `scripts/verify_html_canvas.js`) so CI exercises DOM vs Canvas outputs when `node` is present and emits a skip notice otherwise.
  6. **Documentation**
     - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Documented HTML adapter fidelity tiers, configuration knobs (`max_dom_nodes`, `prefer_dom`, `allow_canvas_fallback`), asset hydration, and debugging steps in `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md`; keep the section current as adapter behavior evolves.
- ‚úÖ (October 20, 2025) Resource loader integration (HTML + renderers) now hydrates image/font assets and persists them under `output/v1/html/assets` using a stable binary `Html::Asset` codec; `Renderer::RenderHtml hydrates image assets into output` and the new `Html::Asset vectors survive PathSpace round-trip` doctest both pass with hydrated bytes.
- ‚úÖ (October 20, 2025) Documented the HTML asset codec (HSAT framing, legacy migration) in `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md`; update the renderer plan when fields or versions change.
- ‚úÖ (October 20, 2025) Removed the legacy Alpaca serializer fallback; HSAT payloads are now required for `output/v1/html/assets`.
- ‚û°Ô∏è Next steps: extend coverage when additional asset fields (e.g., material descriptors) land and add tooling to inspect HSAT payloads from the CLI.

### Phase 8 ‚Äî Widget Toolkit & Interaction Surfaces (post-MVP)
- **Objective:** ship reusable UI widgets (button, toggle, slider, list) that sit on top of the existing scene/render/present stack while reusing PathSpace paths for state and events.
- **Scene authoring**
  - Define canonical widget scene snippets under `scenes/widgets/<widget>/` with snapshot builders that emit visual states (idle, hover, pressed, disabled).
- ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Added lightweight builders for buttons and toggles (`Builders::Widgets::CreateButton`, `CreateToggle`) that publish authoring data, bind to app-relative state paths, and express layout metadata (bounds, z-order).
- ‚úÖ (October 20, 2025) Added a slider builder (`Builders::Widgets::CreateSlider`) with theme metadata, range/state storage, and snapshot generation for the minimal 2D theme.
- Add a reusable stroke primitive (polyline/triangle strip) so paint examples track a point list per stroke instead of emitting per-dab rects; update renderer + HTML adapter to consume the new command once landed.
  - Provide styling hooks (colors, corner radius, typography) so demos can skin widgets without forking scenes.
- **Interaction contract**
  - Wrap Phase‚ÄØ5 hit-test data into a widget interaction API that normalizes hover/press/release and routes to app-defined `ops/` inbox paths.
  - Expose focus navigation helpers (keyboard/gamepad) that reuse the existing `Scene::HitTest` focus metadata and auto-render events to redraw highlight states.
  - Document the path schema for widget state (e.g., `/.../widgets/<id>/{state,enabled,label}`) and ensure updates stay atomic.
- **State binding & data flow**
  - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Introduced initial state update helpers for buttons/toggles that coalesce redundant writes and mark the owning scene `DirtyKind::Visual` only when values change.
  - Introduce a fuller binding layer that watches widget state paths, diffing payloads and pushing dirty hints instead of full-surface republishes. Document ops inbox schemas (button/toggle/slider/list) and sample reducers that translate widget ops into app state mutations via wait/notify.
- **Testing**
  - Extend `PathSpaceUITests` with golden snapshots and interaction sequences for each widget (hover, press, disabled) using the 15√ó loop to guard against race regressions.
  - Add doctest coverage for the binding helpers to confirm dirty-hint emission, focus routing, and auto-render scheduling.
- **Tooling & docs**
  - ‚úÖ (October 19, 2025) Expanded `examples/widgets_example.cpp` to publish button + toggle widgets and demonstrate state updates; grow into a full gallery as additional widgets land.
  - Expand the demo to cover sliders, lists, and interaction telemetry alongside FPS diagnostics and the zero-copy presenter path so contributors can exercise the full toolkit in one app.
  - Introduce an app bootstrap helper that wires renderer/surface/window defaults for a given app root/scene so examples/tests can avoid boilerplate while still exposing escape hatches; update onboarding/docs once available.
  - Update `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md` and `docs/AI_Architecture.md` with widget path conventions, builder usage, and troubleshooting steps.
  - Capture authoring guidelines in `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Implementation.md`'s appendix so contributors can add new widgets consistently.

## Dependencies and Ordering
- Helpers (Phase 1) unblock snapshot builder and surfaces/presenters by standardizing paths.
- Snapshot builder (Phase 2) must land before renderer to provide immutable input revisions.
- Renderer (Phase 3) depends on RenderSettings semantics and DrawableBucket schema from Phase 2.
- Surfaces/presenters (Phase 4) rely on renderer outputs and present policy definitions; progressive mode requires renderer metrics hooks.
- Input/hit testing & notifications (Phase 5) relies on renderer outputs, snapshot metadata, and presenter hooks established in earlier phases.
- Diagnostics/tooling (Phase 6) builds on metrics and error reporting emitted by previous phases; schedule alongside hardening once core flows stabilize.

## Cross-Cutting Concerns
- **Atomicity** ‚Äî All settings and publish operations must remain single-path replacements; tests should assert no partial reads/writes occur.
- **Concurrency** ‚Äî Rely on PathSpace‚Äôs atomic reads/writes, revision epochs, and wait/notify primitives; avoid external mutexes and validate the data-driven coordination model via tests.
- **GC & retention** ‚Äî Implement revision pinning and cleanup thresholds (retain ‚â•3 revisions or ‚â•2 minutes) early to avoid storage issues.
- **Instrumentation** ‚Äî Ensure every phase exposes metrics compatible with the frame profiler plan (`output/v1/common`, progressive stats, diagnostics rings).
- **Notifications** ‚Äî Align dirty markers, wait queues, and auto-render triggers with the scheduling model; cover producer/consumer wakeups in tests.
- **Resources** ‚Äî Respect per-item residency policies, propagate fingerprints consistently, and validate cache eviction rules with tests.
- **Documentation discipline** ‚Äî Mirror behavioral changes in `AI_Architecture.md`, update diagrams as necessary, and capture CLI/tool scripts.

## Testing Strategy
### Current Automation Snapshot (October 19, 2025)
- `./scripts/compile.sh --test --loop=1 --per-test-timeout 20` offers a fast smoke run when chasing regressions.
- `./scripts/compile.sh --enable-metal-tests --test --loop=1 --per-test-timeout 20` exercises the Metal presenter path on macOS hosts; keep it gated behind `PATHSPACE_ENABLE_METAL_UPLOADS` in CI.
- The local `pre-push` hook (`scripts/git-hooks/pre-push.local.sh`) enables Metal presenter coverage by default; export `DISABLE_METAL_TESTS=1` when GPU access is unavailable.
- CI currently runs the Linux matrix plus a macOS job invoking `./scripts/compile.sh --enable-metal-tests --test --loop=1` to guard the presenter path.
- Extend `scripts/compile.sh` to cover new targets and maintain the 15√ó loop with 20 s timeout.
- Add deterministic golden outputs (framebuffers, DrawableBucket metadata) with tolerance-aware comparisons.
- Stress tests: concurrent edits vs renders, present policy edge cases, progressive tile churn, input-routing races, error-path validation (missing revisions, bad settings).
- CI gating: require looped CTest run and lint/format checks before merging.

## Open Questions to Resolve Early
- Finalize `DrawableBucket` binary schema (padding, endianness, checksum) before snapshot/renderer work diverges.
- Decide on minimum color management scope for MVP (srgb8 only vs optional linear FP targets).
- Clarify resource manager involvement for fonts/images in MVP vs deferred phases.
- Validate CAMetalLayer drawable lifetime, IOSurface reuse, and runloop coordination during resize/fullscreen transitions for the Metal presenter.
- Nail down metrics format (`output/v1/common` vs `diagnostics/metrics`) to keep profiler expectations stable.
- Define sequencing for path-traced lighting and tetrahedral acceleration work (post-MVP vs incremental alongside GPU backends).

## Documentation & Rollout Checklist
- Update `README.md` build instructions once UI flags ship.
- Keep `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md` cross-references aligned; link to this implementation plan from that doc and vice versa.
- Add developer onboarding snippets (how to run tests, inspect outputs) to `docs/`.
- Track milestone completion in `AI_Todo.task` or equivalent planning artifact.
- As of October 19, 2025, `docs/AI_Onboarding.md`, `docs/AI_Architecture.md`, `docs/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer.md`, and `docs/AI_Debugging_Playbook.md` already capture the Metal presenter metrics, residency counters, and looped test workflow; keep future changes synchronized across those references.

## Maintenance Considerations
- Ensure feature flags allow partial builds (e.g., disable UI pipeline when unsupported).
- Monitor binary artifact sizes for snapshots; consider tooling to inspect revisions.
- Plan for future GPU backend work without blocking MVP‚Äîkeep interfaces abstract and avoid hard-coding software assumptions.
- Establish guardrails for progressive mode defaults to avoid regressing latency-sensitive apps.
- Respect residency policies and track resource lifecycle metrics so caches stay healthy.
