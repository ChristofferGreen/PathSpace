# Handoff Notice

> **Drafted:** October 20, 2025 — overview of PathSpace planning documents for the current post-handoff cycle.

# PathSpace Plans Overview

## Purpose
Provide a single index of active planning documents, ordered by current priority and grouped by theme. Use this as your starting point before diving into any specific plan.

## Priority Ordering

> **Update (December 12, 2025):** `Plan_WidgetComposableRuntime.md` is complete and archived at `docs/finished/Plan_WidgetComposableRuntime_Finished.md`; capsule-only runtime doc/test sweep finished and the plan is removed from the active queue.
> **Update (December 11, 2025):** `Plan_PathSpaceHtmlServer.md` is complete and archived at `docs/finished/Plan_PathSpaceHtmlServer_Finished.md`; embed-first ServeHtml is now the default path with CI coverage for standalone and embedded helpers.
> **Update (December 10, 2025):** `Plan_SceneGraph` (formerly `docs/Plan_SceneGraph.md`) is complete and archived at `docs/finished/Plan_SceneGraph_Finished.md`. Use it for the finalized scene graph/diagnostics rollout record; it no longer appears in the active list below.
> **Update (December 6, 2025):** `Plan_Distributed_PathSpace.md` is complete and archived at `docs/finished/Plan_Distributed_PathSpace_Finished.md`. Use it as the distributed mount contract reference while the list below tracks active plans.
> **Update (December 4, 2025):** `Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer` is complete and archived at `docs/finished/Plan_SceneGraph_Renderer_Finished.md`. Use it as the renderer/presenter contract reference while the plans below track active or ongoing work.

1. **Plan_PathSpaceWindowManager.md**  
   Queued: NextStep-inspired window chrome/dock controller building atop the stabilized renderer/runtime stack; depends on the composable runtime landing first.

2. **Plan_PathSpaceTerminal.md**  
   Queued: Carta Linea-aware terminal/launcher that captures command outputs as PathSpaces; green-lit once the window manager primitives exist so terminal panes can host arbitrary viewers.

3. **Plan_Surface_Ray_Cache.md** (deferred)  
   GPU-path backlog; revisit when ray-query acceleration re-enters scope after the current HTML/runtime deliveries.

4. **Plan_CartaLinea.md** (paused)  
   Cross-app deck/timeline/filesystem concept; stays paused until renderer + ServeHtml milestones finish and window manager UX is validated.

5. **Plan_PrimeScript.md**  
   Unified scripting/shading language roadmap spanning host C++, GPU backends, and the embedded VM; follow the language spec and syntax draft in `docs/PrimeScript_SyntaxSpec.md` when prototyping.


## Recommended Implementation Focus (Q4 2025)
1. **Plan_PathSpaceWindowManager.md** — begin chrome/dock design now that the composable runtime is finished, enabling multi-window UX for apps that lean on the new renderer stack.
2. **Plan_PathSpaceTerminal.md** — unblock terminal/launcher prototypes after the window manager foundation exists; keep Carta Linea integration requirements in scope during design.
3. **Plan_SceneGraph_Finished.md** — archived; use for renderer/diagnostics history, goldens, and wrap-up notes.
4. **Plan_PathSpaceHtmlServer_Finished.md** — archived; reference for ServeHtml embedding, CI coverage, and example migrations.

Deferred / paused tracks: **Plan_Surface_Ray_Cache.md** (GPU path) and **Plan_CartaLinea.md** (experience) stay out of the active rotation until the ServeHtml/runtime/window manager sequence is done.

## Status Snapshot — December 1, 2025
- ✅ (December 12, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WidgetComposableRuntime_Finished.md` captures the completed capsule-only runtime rollout (mailboxes + primitives), doc/test sweep, and removal of legacy reducer/event inbox mirrors.
- (December 11, 2025) Plan_PathSpaceHtmlServer completed and archived at `docs/finished/Plan_PathSpaceHtmlServer_Finished.md`: PathSpaceHtmlServer helper + builder ship with example migrations (`--html-server`), docs refreshed, and CI runs ServeHtml HTTP/SSE/Google integration plus embedded smoke (`PathSpaceHtmlServerEmbed`).
- ✅ (December 6, 2025) `docs/Plan_Distributed_PathSpace.md` graduated to `docs/finished/Plan_Distributed_PathSpace_Finished.md`, capturing the full distributed mount implementation (phases 0–2, diagnostics, TLS, throttling) so remote web/server work references a stable contract.
- ✅ (December 5, 2025) RemoteMountServer Phase 0 export landed (`src/pathspace/distributed/RemoteMountServer.{hpp,cpp}` + `tests/unit/distributed/test_RemoteMountServer.cpp`): server-side exports now validate aliases, stream wait notifications, publish `/inspector/metrics/remotes/<alias>/server/*`, and log `/diagnostics/web/inspector/acl/<alias>/events/*` entries so the client + diagnostics backlog can build on a working transport.
- ✅ (December 5, 2025) RemoteMountManager Phase 0 client landed (`src/pathspace/distributed/RemoteMountManager.{hpp,cpp}` + `tests/unit/distributed/test_RemoteMountManager.cpp`): mounts now appear under `/remote/<alias>`, blocking reads bridge onto remote wait subscriptions, and client metrics/heartbeat health flow through `/inspector/metrics/remotes/<alias>/client/*` for ServeHtml + inspector consumers.
- ✅ (December 6, 2025) RemoteMount TLS transport landed (`src/pathspace/distributed/RemoteMountTls.{hpp,cpp}` + new TLS cert fixtures/tests): `RemoteMountTlsServer` wraps the export manager behind a mutual-TLS listener, `RemoteMountTlsSessionFactory` dials mounts over length-prefixed RemoteMountProtocol frames, diagnostics log JSON `{code,message,subject,audience,fingerprint}`, and `tests/unit/distributed/test_RemoteMountManager.cpp` now exercises the TLS path with the sample CA/cert/key bundle under `tests/data/remote_mount_tls/`.
- ✅ (December 6, 2025) `PathSpace::relocateSubtree` removal completed; all inspector/widget movers now rely on nested `PathSpace` take+insert flows and the helper has been deleted. See `docs/finished/Plan_RemoveRelocateSubtree_Finished.md` for the archived rationale and schema notes.
- ✅ (December 4, 2025) `Plan_ServeHtml_Modularization` finished: options parsing,
  session/auth backends, routing/controllers, SSE broadcasting, metrics
  publishing, and demo scaffolding all live in dedicated modules with unit+
  integration coverage. See `docs/serve_html/README.md` for the active module
  guide and `docs/finished/Plan_ServeHtml_Modularization_Finished.md` for the
  historical record.
- ✅ (December 2, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 1 auth milestone landed: `pathspace_serve_html` now enforces bcrypt-backed `/login` + HTTP-only cookies, exposes `/logout` and `/session`, seeds demo credentials, and documents its knobs in `docs/web_server.toml`.
- 🚧 (December 2, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 0 prototype is live: `pathspace_serve_html` (tools/serve_html.cpp) serves `/apps/<app>/<view>` directly from `renderers/<renderer>/targets/html/<view>/output/v1/html/{dom,css,js,commands}` and seeds a demo gallery via `--seed-demo`. Remaining gaps before Phase 2: config-driven renderer selection and CDN/backfill plumbing for the new `/assets` route.
- ✅ (December 2, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Next Action 3 shipped: `paint_example` and `widgets_example` now have `--export-html <dir>` which emits DOM/CSS/commands/assets bundles (`dom.html`, `styles.css`, `commands.json`, `metadata.txt`, `assets_manifest.txt`, `assets/*`) for the prototype server and future CDN workflows; README documents the workflow.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Next Action 4 shipped: `/apps/<app>/<view>/events` now streams SSE with frame/diagnostic/reload payloads, honors Last-Event-ID, ships a demo refresh flag, and is covered by `tests/tools/test_pathspace_serve_html_sse.py`.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Next Action 5 shipped: new headless test `tests/tools/test_pathspace_serve_html_http.py` logs in to `pathspace_serve_html`, enforces the 401 auth gate, and verifies `/apps/<app>/<view>` responds 200 with the documented caching headers.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 5 observability landed: `/metrics` exposes the new request/op/SSE/asset/rate-limit counters, the JSON snapshot lives under `<apps_root>/io/metrics/web_server/serve_html/live`, and the HTTP/SSE integration tests now cover `/metrics`, asset 304s, session expiry, and Last-Event-ID reconnects with the matching runbook updates in `docs/AI_Debugging_Playbook.md`.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 6 external IdP integration landed: `/login/google` + `/login/google/callback` now wrap Google OAuth (PKCE), verify ID tokens via JWKS, and map `/system/auth/oauth/google/<sub>` entries to usernames before issuing the standard session. The new `[auth.google]` block in `docs/web_server.toml`, the debugging playbook (§9.6), and `tests/tools/test_pathspace_serve_html_google.py` document + guard the flow. The plan has been archived as `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md`.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 3 kicked off: `pathspace_serve_html` now exposes `POST /api/ops/<op>` (JSON `{app,schema,payload}`, ≤ 1 MiB) that enqueues into `/system/applications/<app>/ops/<op>/inbox/queue`. The seeded demo button calls the endpoint and the HTTP integration test posts to it to guard auth + payload handling.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 1 asset milestone landed: `/assets/<app>/<relative>` streams `output/v1/html/assets/{data,meta}` with immutable cache headers, honors `If-None-Match`, and the HTTP integration test now exercises the seeded demo asset so future CDN + remote deployments have a proven baseline.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `pathspace_serve_html` now injects an EventSource live-update script plus `/apps/<app>/<view>?format=json` payload mode so browser views hot-swap DOM/CSS/commands and surface diagnostics automatically, closing the Phase 2 follow-up in `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md`.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Next Action 6 shipped: refreshed `docs/Plan_Overview.md` + `docs/AI_Debugging_Playbook.md` with the web adapter troubleshooting details and added Phase 3–5 backlog entries to `docs/AI_TODO.task` so downstream plans can track dual-delivery, hardened deployment, and observability work.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 4 kickoff landed: the server now supports `--session-store {memory|pathspace}` (persisting sessions under `/system/web/sessions` when PathSpace-backed) and the plan captures HTTPS termination guidance (NGINX/Caddy TLS snippets + health checks) so production deployments can safely front the adapter with real certificates.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 4 scaling notes landed: the new "Scaling & Multi-Server Deployments" section plus `docs/web_server.toml` `[scaling.multi_instance]` guidance document how multiple `pathspace_serve_html` instances share sessions, assets, and PathSpace roots behind a load balancer.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Phase 4 rate limiting milestone landed: `pathspace_serve_html` now enforces configurable per-IP/per-session token buckets (`--rate-limit-{ip,session}-{per-minute,burst}`), emits `429` JSON payloads when throttled, and appends structured entries to `<app_root>/io/log/security/request_rejections`; the HTTP regression runs with a low-burst config to keep the middleware validated.
- ✅ (December 11, 2025) PathSpaceHtmlServer Phase 3 landed: `paint_example`/`widgets_example` now expose a single `--html-server` toggle that builds the embeddable helper (HtmlMirror bootstrap + demo credential seeding, auto-assigned port) instead of bespoke `--serve-html*` flags and manual threads.
- ✅ (December 3, 2025) `docs/finished/Plan_WebServer_Adapter_Finished.md` Next Action 7 cleared: `SceneLifecycle::InvalidateThemes` now sync-dirties app + window widgets when `ThemeConfig::SetActive` switches themes, eliminating the `PathSpaceUITests` Loop 4 focus/theme flake and keeping the workflow commit loop green.
- ✅ (December 1, 2025) `Plan_PathSpace_Inspector_Finished.md` Phase 1 is underway: the bundled SPA now exposes SSE-driven search + watchlist panes with manual refresh fallback, aligning `/inspector/stream` with the live UI and capturing the remaining TODOs (rate limiting, diagnostics, backlog entries) directly in the plan.
- ✅ (December 1, 2025) `Plan_PathSpace_Inspector_Finished.md` backpressure work landed: `InspectorHttpServer` enforces per-client SSE budgets, `/inspector/metrics/stream` + `/inspector/metrics/stream/*` publish queue/dropped/resent/disconnect counters, and the SPA’s stream-health card visualizes them so dashboards no longer have to scrape logs.
- ✅ (December 1, 2025) Inspector search/watch diagnostics shipped: `/inspector/metrics/search` (mirrored under `/inspector/metrics/search/*`) records query totals, latency, truncation counts, and watchlist status mixes, and the SPA now posts metrics + badges so ACL hits or truncated searches stand out without scraping logs.
- ✅ (December 1, 2025) Inspector browser automation landed: the Playwright SSE + manual suites under `tests/inspector/playwright/tests/` validate search/watchlist flows (including manual-refresh fallback) and run through `scripts/ci_inspector_tests.sh --loop=5` inside the workflow.
- ✅ (December 1, 2025) Inspector multi-root picker + `/inspector/remotes` endpoint landed: the backend now publishes each remote alias (path, connection state, `access_hint`, last update) and the SPA persists quick-root selections via URL + `localStorage` while surfacing status pills/hover hints for VPN/auth requirements.
- ✅ (December 1, 2025) Inspector embedding guidance published: `docs/finished/Plan_PathSpace_Inspector_Finished.md` now documents how to host `InspectorHttpServer` inside apps (options, SSE tuning, UI overrides), `docs/AI_Debugging_Playbook.md` contains the matching runbook, and Plan Overview can point downstream plans at a single source of truth.
- ✅ (December 1, 2025) Inspector remote mounts online: the backend now ingests distributed PathSpace mounts declared in `InspectorHttpServer::Options::remote_mounts`, mirrors their trees under `/remote/<alias>`, exposes mount health in `/inspector/tree` diagnostics, and multiplexes remote deltas into `/inspector/stream`, unblocking Phase 2 of `Plan_PathSpace_Inspector_Finished.md`.
- ✅ (December 2, 2025) Inspector plan archived: all Phase 0–4 backlog entries are complete, so `docs/finished/Plan_PathSpace_Inspector_Finished.md` replaces the in-flight plan and downstream docs now link to the finished reference.
- ✅ (November 28, 2025) Legacy builder runtime removed: the `SP::UI::Runtime` headers and `*Runtime.cpp` sources now own the UI helper surface, `LegacyBuildersDeprecation` + kill-switch guards were deleted, CI/pre-push rely solely on the declarative/runtime pipeline, and the Phase 4 post-mortem is published in `docs/finished/Plan_WidgetDeclarativeAPI_Finished.md`.
- ✅ (November 25, 2025) Declarative doc alignment complete: README, onboarding guides, and the widget contribution quickstart now point contributors at `docs/WidgetDeclarativeAPI.md`, mark legacy builders as compatibility-only, and reference the parity + migration tracker so Phase 3 of `Plan_WidgetDeclarativeAPI` can progress to deprecation prep.
- ✅ (November 25, 2025) Phase 3 feature audit for `Plan_WidgetDeclarativeAPI` published (`docs/WidgetDeclarativeFeatureParity.md`). The matrix confirms declarative-vs-legacy parity for widgets, focus, telemetry, and samples; remaining Phase 3 work tracks perf validation plus accessibility automation.
- ✅ (November 25, 2025) Authored `docs/WidgetDeclarativeAPI.md` to capture the operational workflow (runtime bootstrap, fragments, handler registry, readiness guard, paint/history bindings, migration/testing checklist). `docs/AI_Onboarding.md`, `docs/AI_Onboarding_Next.md`, and `docs/Widget_Contribution_Quickstart.md` now link to it so contributors follow the declarative process before touching code.
- ✅ (November 25, 2025) Legacy builder deprecation telemetry landed: every legacy `SP::UI::Runtime::*` entry now records usage under `/_system/diagnostics/legacy_widget_builders/<entry>/*` and the runtime honors `PATHSPACE_LEGACY_WIDGET_BUILDERS={allow,warn,error}` (default `warn`) so CI and pre-push hooks can flip to hard failures ahead of the February 1, 2026 support-window cutoff.
- ✅ (November 17, 2025) IO Trellis Phase 1 landed: `CreateIOTrellis` now drains `/system/devices/in/{pointer,text,keyboard,gamepad}` providers, emits canonical events under `/system/io/events/{pointer,button,text}`, exposes metrics at `/system/io/events/metrics/*`, and ships with coverage in `tests/unit/io/test_IoTrellis.cpp`. Telemetry stays off until `/_system/telemetry/io/events_enabled` is toggled.
- ✅ (November 17, 2025) IO Pump Phase 2 landed: `CreateIOPump` registers window subscriptions under `/system/widgets/runtime/windows/<token>`, forwards Trellis events into `/system/widgets/runtime/events/<token>/{pointer,button,text}/queue` (with `/global/*` fallbacks), and records per-stream metrics plus drop counts beside the existing input runtime stats.
- ✅ (November 14, 2025) PathSpaceTrellis fan-in layer rebuilt; see `docs/finished/Plan_PathSpaceTrellis_Finished.md` for the final notes.
- ✅ (November 10, 2025) Snapshot infrastructure removed: `UndoableSpace` now ships journal-only history, the snapshot codecs/tests/inspection tooling are gone, and `pathspace_history_inspect` reports journal metrics (entries, inserts, takes, barriers) instead of decoding snapshot payloads. Persistence/import/export paths operate solely on mutation logs.
- ✅ (November 10, 2025) Journal persistence format is now documented for tooling consumers. See `docs/AI_Architecture.md` (“Journal Persistence Format”) for header layout, entry schema, and versioning guidance.
- ✅ (November 9, 2025) Journal telemetry now computes undo/redo/live byte totals directly from `UndoJournalState::stats`, removing the runtime dependency on replaying snapshot prototypes and paving the way for Phase 4 snapshot code removal.
- ✅ (November 9, 2025) Journal savefiles export/import via `history.journal.v1`; `UndoableSpaceSavefile.cpp` and `UndoSavefileCodec` stream journal entries with retention options, providing parity for undo/redo cursors and dropping snapshot payload packing.
- ✅ (November 9, 2025) Multi-threaded journal stress coverage now runs inside `tests/unit/history/test_UndoableSpace.cpp` (“journal handles concurrent mutation and history operations”), interleaving inserts, takes, undo/redo, and manual garbage-collect commands on four threads. The harness drains and replays the journal to assert cursor stability, covering the Phase 3 stress-test requirement from the Undo Journal rewrite plan.
- ✅ (November 9, 2025) Deterministic fuzz coverage for the undo journal (`tests/unit/history/test_UndoableSpace.cpp`, “journal fuzz sequence maintains parity with reference model”) now exercises random insert/take/undo/redo/garbage-collect sequences against a pure reference model, trimming stacks via telemetry to surface replay drift.
- ✅ (November 10, 2025) Snapshot-versus-journal benchmarking stays published via `benchmarks/history/undo_journal_benchmark.cpp` (enable with `-DBUILD_PATHSPACE_BENCHMARKS=ON`) and now cites the migration runbook: telemetry parity holds after the doc/tooling sweep, and the operator guide for exporting legacy snapshot persistence with the November 9 bridge commit lives in `docs/AI_Debugging_Playbook.md`.
- ✅ (November 8, 2025) Journal persistence now replays mutation logs on enable, restoring live node state and history from `journal.log`. Compaction runs after retention/GC, telemetry reflects disk usage, and the regression `tests/unit/history/test_UndoableSpace.cpp` (“journal persistence replays entries on enable”) covers the load path.
- ✅ (November 8, 2025) Persistence namespaces and encoded roots now pass compile-time token guards and runtime validation, rejecting path traversal tokens before wiring journal or snapshot persistence. Regression coverage lives in `tests/unit/history/test_UndoableSpace.cpp` (“persistence namespace validation rejects path traversal tokens”).
- ✅ (November 8, 2025) Journal telemetry endpoints now serve data via the mutation journal. `_history/stats/*`, `_history/lastOperation/*`, and `_history/unsupported/*` all flow through the new aggregator built on `UndoJournalState::Stats`, with commit-time retention syncing and regression coverage (`tests/unit/history/test_UndoableSpace.cpp`, `tests/unit/history/test_UndoJournalState.cpp`).
- ✅ (November 8, 2025) Journal-backed history roots now honor the `_history/undo|redo|garbage_collect|set_manual_garbage_collect` control paths. Manual retention defers trimming until the GC command runs, and new tests (`tests/unit/history/test_UndoableSpace.cpp`, `tests/unit/history/test_UndoJournalState.cpp`) cover the command routing and retention behaviour. Telemetry endpoints remain in-progress per the Undo Journal rewrite plan.
- ✅ (November 7, 2025) UndoableSpace persistence and unsupported-payload coverage remain solid, and the persistence-format bake-off is resolved: entry/state metadata now emits compact versioned binary headers, recovery paths share a single codec, and the undo tests cover encode/decode round-trips. Savefile export/import helpers (`UndoableSpace::exportHistorySavefile` / `importHistorySavefile`) now emit PSJL bundles with undo/redo retention honored, and the automation (`HistorySavefileCLIRoundTrip`, `pathspace_history_cli_roundtrip`) keeps the binaries honest while we transition to journal-only tooling.
- ✅ (November 1, 2025) `history::CowSubtreePrototype` landed as the copy-on-write prototype for undo history, with instrumentation/tests in place and `docs/finished/Plan_PathSpace_Finished.md` updated; `scripts/run-test-with-logs.sh` now hardens mktemp handling so the 5× loop stays stable; `docs/finished/Plan_PathSpace_UndoHistory_Finished.md` captures the layered design, transactions, retention, and persistence roadmap.
- ✅ (October 24, 2025) PathSurfaceMetal now allocates IOSurface-backed textures when `iosurface_backing` is set, keeping Metal surface caching in step with CAMetalLayer presentation and the updated UITest coverage.
- ✅ (October 24, 2025) `./scripts/compile.sh --test` now auto-enables example builds, runs the PixelNoise perf harness (software + Metal) inside the mandated 5× loop, and sets the looped per-test timeout baseline to 20 s so regressions surface without bespoke CTest invocations.
- HSAT (HTML asset codec) remains mandatory and documented; `pathspace_hsat_inspect` regression stays green after the latest loop run.
- HTML tooling quickstart/troubleshooting note now lives in `docs/HTML_Adapter_Quickstart.md` (published October 22, 2025) so incoming maintainers can run the HSAT + HTML harness without rediscovering the workflow.
- Pixel noise perf harness (`examples/pixel_noise_example.cpp`) still supports both Software2D and Metal backends, and baselines live under `docs/perf/`; however, the old `PixelNoisePerfHarness*` CTest entries were removed from the default loop. Use `python3 scripts/check_pixel_noise_baseline.py --build-dir build [--baseline ...]` when you need to compare against the recorded budgets, and expect the ServeHtml/example rewrite to provide the next automated gate. ✅ (October 23, 2025) Captured a representative frame grab for the harness (`docs/images/perf/pixel_noise.png`) using the new `pixel_noise_example --write-frame=<path>` option so perf regressions include a visual alongside the metrics.
- Default software presents now skip serializing `SoftwareFramebuffer`; the capture path remains opt-in via `capture_framebuffer=true`, keeping production presents on direct IOSurface writes.
- Widget state scenes now publish canonical idle/hover/pressed/disabled snapshots under `scenes/widgets/<id>/states/*`; theme-aware styles (`Widgets::WidgetTheme`) landed and `widgets_example` uses env-selectable palettes without rewriting scenes.
- ✅ (October 23, 2025) Phase 8 widget bindings fuzz harness landed (`tests/ui/test_WidgetReducersFuzz.cpp`), covering randomized pointer/keyboard flows, reducer drains, and republished action queues; monitor follow-on coverage in `docs/finished/Plan_SceneGraph_Finished.md`.
- ✅ (October 22, 2025) Split the monolithic `ui/Builders.cpp` into focused translation units (Scene/Renderer/Surface/Window/App/Widgets/Diagnostics + shared detail helpers), keeping each under 1 000 lines and revalidating the 5× looped CTest run.
- ✅ (October 23, 2025) Follow-up split trims widget internals further: widget helpers now live in `WidgetDrawablesDetail.inl` and `WidgetMetadataDetail.inl`, with runtime code in `WidgetBuildersCore.cpp`, `WidgetBindings.cpp`, `WidgetFocus.cpp`, and `WidgetReducers.cpp`, keeping the largest TU under 1 000 lines post-refactor.
- ✅ (October 23, 2025) Broke `WidgetDrawablesDetail.inl` into per-widget include shards (common/button/toggle/slider/list) so each inline module remains compact while `WidgetDetail.hpp` still exposes a single entry point.
- ✅ (October 23, 2025) Captured fresh PathRenderer2D FPS traces for 1280×720 and 3840×2160 using `scripts/capture_renderer_fps_traces.py`; results live in `docs/perf/renderer_fps_traces.json` so perf reviews can diff incremental vs full-surface behaviour.
