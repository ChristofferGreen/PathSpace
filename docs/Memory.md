## Repository Memory
This file is for remembering architecture details about the PathSPace project so it becomes easier to get up to speed about details later.
No need to store details about a worklog of dates when things where added.

- 2025-11-18: WidgetEventTrellis mutates declarative widget state (button hover/press, toggle checked, slider value/dragging, list hover/selection, tree hover/expanded) and flips `render/dirty` before emitting each `WidgetOp`, so declarative apps stay in sync without handlers touching `widgets/<id>/state/*`.
- 2025-11-18: Keyboard + gamepad navigation calls `Widgets::Focus::Move` (Tab/Shift+Tab or shoulder/D-pad hops) to rewrite `<app>/widgets/focus/current`, and InputTask exposes per-widget handler telemetry at `widgets/<id>/metrics/handlers/{invoked_total,failures_total,missing_total}` to pinpoint flaky/missing callbacks; slider/list/tree arrow routing is still pending inside WidgetEventTrellis.
- 2025-11-18: Declarative paint surfaces persist `state/history/<stroke-id>/{meta,points}`, track `render/buffer/revision`, queue `DirtyRectHint`s under `render/buffer/pendingDirty` + `/render/gpu/dirtyRects`, and let the `/system/widgets/runtime/paint_gpu` uploader rasterize stroke history into `assets/texture` while SceneLifecycle forwards pending rectangles to renderer hints.
- 2025-11-18: Declarative paint-surface tests must shut down the runtime after launching (`RuntimeGuard`) to avoid leaving worker threads around for subsequent suites.
- 2025-11-18: `WidgetFragment` now carries handler specs; `Widgets::Mount` rebinds them automatically and `Widgets::Handlers::{Read,Replace,Wrap,Restore}` exposes a supported way to intercept or restore declarative callbacks without poking raw `events/<event>/handler` nodes.
- 2025-11-18: Theme resolver now walks `config/theme/<name>/style/inherits` (depth cap 16), falls back to the nearest ancestor that stores a `WidgetTheme` payload, and errors on cycles; edits are picked up automatically the next time descriptors read the theme.
- 2025-11-18: WidgetEventTrellis now falls back to `<app>/widgets/focus/current` when per-scene focus mirrors are missing and routes keyboard/gamepad Space/Enter/A/A-button presses into the same Press/Release/Activate/Toggle ops as pointer clicks for focused buttons/toggles; slider/list/tree arrow handling remains TODO.
- 2025-11-19: Declarative telemetry/logging landed — schema loads write `/system/widgets/runtime/schema/metrics/*` + `/log/events`, focus transitions drive `scene/runtime/focus/metrics/*` and `widgets/<id>/metrics/focus/*`, InputTask publishes loop latency + backlog alongside handler logs under `widgets/<id>/log/events`, and SceneLifecycle records `dirty_batch_ns`, `publish_ns`, and parity diffs (with `runtime/lifecycle/log/compare` for mismatches).
- 2025-11-19: Keyboard/gamepad parity finished — WidgetEventTrellis steps sliders/lists/trees via arrow/D-pad/shoulder inputs and synthesizes `TextDelete`, `TextMoveCursor`, and `TextSubmit` ops for focused input fields, with regression coverage in `tests/ui/test_WidgetEventTrellis.cpp`.
- 2025-11-19: WidgetEventTrellis refactored into dedicated worker/pointer/focus translation units (plus shared helpers/state mutators) and declarative descriptor loaders moved under `DescriptorDetail.{hpp,cpp}` so each TU stays <1k LOC; CMake now builds the new files explicitly.
- 2025-11-19: `SP::UI::Declarative::Theme` exposes `Create`, `SetColor`, and `RebuildValue`; color tokens live under `/system/applications/<app>/themes/<name>/colors/<token>` and compile back into `config/theme/<name>/value`, so updating a token immediately invalidates declarative scenes via `SceneLifecycle::InvalidateThemes`.
- 2025-11-19: Declarative theme workflow now has regression coverage (`tests/ui/test_DeclarativeTheme.cpp` verifies inheritance + `Theme::RebuildValue`) and a runnable reference sample (`examples/declarative_theme_example.cpp`) that seeds sunrise/sunset themes via `Theme::{Create,SetColor}` before mounting declarative widgets.
- 2025-11-19: Declarative widget demos (`examples/widgets_example.cpp`, `examples/widgets_example_minimal.cpp`, `examples/declarative_hello_example.cpp`) now share `examples/declarative_example_shared.hpp`, which wraps `SP::System::LaunchStandard`, registers `/system/devices/in/{pointer,text}/default` subscriptions, forwards `LocalWindowBridge` events into the IO pump, and funnels presents through `Builders::App::PresentToLocalWindow`; new samples should reuse this helper instead of reimplementing the bootstrap loop.
- 2025-11-19: Declarative `paint_example` mounts palette + slider controls through `SP::UI::Declarative` widgets, writes brush metadata under `state/brush/*`, and wraps the widget root in a `PathAlias` → `UndoableSpace` view so the sample’s Undo/Redo buttons exercise the journaled paint history without touching legacy builders.
- 2025-11-19: `SP::Window::Create` seeds default renderer target settings when `/renderers/.../targets/.../settings` is missing so new declarative apps can resolve presenter bootstraps without running the legacy builder bootstrap first.
- 2025-11-19: Declarative stacks persist `layout/{style,children,computed}` metadata plus per-panel order/visibility, so descriptors reuse the stack preview builder with an active highlight instead of returning empty buckets; paint surfaces now emit a buffer-sized background quad before replaying strokes, ensuring canvases publish geometry and dirty hints even before history exists.
